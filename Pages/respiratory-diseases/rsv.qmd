# Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) {.unnumbered}

## National Syndromic Surveillance Program

The National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) consolidates data from many sources and on a wide range of subjects to provide timely, complete, and accurate information in partnership with federal agencies, local and state health departments, and academic and private sector partners. Among these data sources, emergency department (ED) visit data resulting from influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and COVID-19 respiratory infections are available on data.gov. 83\% of United States ED departments provide data to NSSP within 24 hours, and percentage occurrences at the state and county level are released weekly\ [@main_page_nssp; @data_source_nssp].

### Limitations

The following summarizes specific data collection, processing, and reporting characteristics that might impact the interpretation of results. These reflect source limitations provided by the _[Companion Guide: NSSP ED Data on Respiratory Illness](https://www.cdc.gov/nssp/php/onboarding-resources/companion-guide-ed-data-respir)_ and internal PopHIVE data processing methods\ [@ed_data_guide]. Relevant PopHIVE data processing scripts are directly linked to as needed.

- To comply with data use and sharing agreements, county-level data are suppressed from New Hampshire, South Dakota, and Washington.

- If the proportion of records with a discharge diagnosis is low or the counts of observed events are sufficiently low, reports are suppressed to ensure data privacy. This suppression can impact the resolution at both the county and state levels.

- Data are reported based on the electronic diagnostic codes (listed above) generated during an emergency department visit, rather than directly from the viral detection assay. Testing practices, and code assignment standards, are also expected to differ for the viruses, hospital systems, and for specific age groups.

- Data are updated by NSSP as qualifying discharge diagnoses (DD) codes are added and changed.

- During data processing, where available, county-level values are shown; otherwise, they are replaced with state-level values ([`ingest.R`](https://github.com/PopHIVE/Ingest/blob/main/data/nssp/ingest.R)).

## Epic Cosmos

Cosmos is a dataset created in collaboration with a community of Epic health systems representing more than 300 million patient records from over 1633 hospitals and 37,900 clinics from all 50 states, D.C., Canada, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. Summary statistics were obtained using the SlicerDicer tool in Epic Cosmos.

-   ED visits: Percent of ED visits recorded as being due to RSV, obtained from facilities using the Epic electronic health records platform and participating in Epic Cosmos. Epic Cosmos captures varying amounts of the population in different regions, so the data might be a more representative measure of viral activity in the community in some areas than others.

-   Where there are fewer than 10 cases per time period, the data are suppressed. These values are filled in with a value halfway between 0 and the minimum reported value on the time series. These values are noted with suppressed_flag=1


## RESP-NET

The CDC’s Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) monitors laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations associated with influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) among children and adults. Pathogen-specific installments of the surveillance program (COVID-NET, RSV-NET, and FluSurv-NET) operate distinctly, yet together they contribute to RESP-NET’s surveillance and data collection efforts.

Data are collected from hospitals in select counties and county equivalents across up to 14 states, representing more than 30 million people, approximately 10\% of the U.S. population\ [@resp_net_docs]. RESP-NET defines pathogen-specific surveillance areas around participating hospitals, allowing rates to be accurately reported. Each program collects data on age, sex, and race and ethnicity demographics. Officials strive to capture all cases within the catchment area to ensure a representative understanding of who is impacted by the disease burden\ [@resp_net_docs].

### Limitations

The following summarizes specific data collection, processing, and reporting characteristics that might impact the interpretation of results. These reflect source limitations provided by the _[Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET)](https://www.cdc.gov/resp-net/dashboard/index.html)_ and internal PopHIVE data processing methods, unless otherwise noted\ [@resp_net_docs]. Relevant PopHIVE data processing scripts are directly linked to as needed.

- The participating surveillance sites have experienced changes over time, resulting in the addition or removal of counties represented in new surveillance years. RESP-NET adjusts the total population estimates to account for these variations.

- During the 2020-21 season, the case counts from FluSurv-NET were insufficient to report stratified cumulative or weekly rates. Consequently, only the overall rates were reported.

- The RSV-NET data was marked as incomplete from May to June 2022.

- The COVID-NET program began in March 2020 and has continued to the present day. Both the FluSurv-NET and RSV-NET programs started in October 2018 and also continue to the present day.

- Active surveillance dates within a season begin in October (MMWR Week 40) and end either at the end of April (MMWR Week 17), June (MMWR Week 16), or September (MMWR Week 39) of the following year. In some seasons, programs concluded surveillance in different months\ [@resp_net_docs; @covid_net_dashboard; @rsv_net_dashboard]. Refer to page 6 of the embedded PowerBI dashboard provided below for specific details about the date ranges captured in each season by surveillance program.

- The number of hospitals participating in each respiratory illness surveillance program varies, but all platforms have overlapping surveillance areas. Fourteen states submit data for influenza surveillance, while thirteen states submit data for COVID-19 and RSV surveillance.

- Although the areas surrounding the hospitals are well described, these regions are pathogen-specific and may not directly correspond between the three programs represented in RESP-NET.

- Prior to the 2020-21 season, population estimates utilized NCHS bridge-race estimates. Starting with the 2020-21 season, unbridged estimates from the 2020-22 Special Tabulation vintage have been used as denominators.

- Data reported within a season are considered to be preliminary and are subject to updates, as reports are received from participating sites. This reporting lag is expected to increase around holidays and during periods of increased hospitalization\ [@flusurv_net_docs; @covid_net_dashboard].

- Surveillance relies on clinical testing ordered by healthcare providers and reported rates do not account for any resulting undertesting, differences between facilities, or diagnostic test sensitivity.


### Coverage Map

RESP-NET provides summary tables and visualizations showing the participating states and the date ranges for active surveillance for every season, organized by surveillance program. The [RESP-NET PowerBI dashboard](https://www.cdc.gov/resp-net/dashboard/index.html) displaying this information has been embedded below\ [@resp_net_docs].

## RSV-NET

The Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET) is a network that conducts active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated hospitalizations in children younger than 18 years of age and adults. RSV-NET, along with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) an the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance network (FluSuv-NET), comprise the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET).  The RESP-NET platforms have overlapping surveillance areas and use similar methods to collect data. Because the surveillance areas and age groups included in surveillance have changed over time, trends should be interpreted with caution. RSV-NET is CDC’s source for important data on rates of hospitalizations associated with RSV. Hospitalization rates show how many people in the surveillance area are hospitalized with RSV, compared to the total number of people residing in that area. \n\nData are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data will be updated weekly.

### Limitations

Many of the same limitations apply here.

-   Number of laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus per 100,000 people. RESP-NET is an active surveillance system with a well-defined population, so it is possible to obtain estimates of incidence (cases/population). This indicator is only available for certain states. The data comes from certain counties within the state and does not capture the entire population.

- The populations for children under 6 months and those aged 6-12 months are each estimated to be half of the population of children aged 0-1 years.


### Coverage Map

RSV-NET provides summary visualizations showing the participating states and an estimate of the percentage of the population represented for each season. The [RSV-NET PowerBI dashboard](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/php/surveillance/rsv-net.html) displaying this information has been embedded below\ [@rsv_net_dashboard].

## National Wastewater Surveillance program 

Testing for viruses in wastewater can provide an efficient way to identify the levels of virus circulation in the community. The CDC’s National Wastewater Surveillance program obtains samples from select communities around the US and presents the data aggregated by state. These data can provide an early indication of viral activity. Limitations include an inability to link detected back to particular groups of individuals and challenges in comparing viral levels across sites that use different methodologies. The sewage is not necessarily representative of the entire population. These data are made available by the CDC.

-   Wastewater virus activity level (WVAL) value is calculated by CDC as exp(\# of standard deviations above baseline). The WVAL therefore represents a measure of relative intensity. The [methods](https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/about-data.html#data-method) for calculating the baseline vary by virus.

## Google Trends API

Google Trends data represent scaled Google search volume by week and state or metropolitan area and are obtained from the Google Health Trends API for non-commercial purposes.

-   This represents the volume of Google searches for ‘RSV’, statistically adjusted to remove searches related to RSV immunizations. We obtained Google Search volume by week and state for ‘RSV’ and for the category ‘Respiratory syncytial virus vaccine’ (11j30ybfx6). We are interested in searches related to clinical activity, not due to searching for information on the vaccine. These two time series show distinct patterns. Searches for RSV vaccines surge in early-Fall. Searches for ‘rsv’ in general have a small hump in early fall that corresponds to the searches for vaccine information, and a second peak later in the fall and into the winter that corresponds to the seasonal epidemic.

-   To subtract out the signal of vaccination searches from the general RSV signal, we fit a mixed effects model where the outcome was search volume for RSV by state and week, the covariate was search volume for RSV vaccines by week and state in the summer months, and there was a random intercept for state. There was an interaction term for ‘season’, which allowed the effect of search volume to differ in July-October. Using the regression coefficients, we calculate the adjusted search volume as Adjusted volume = RSV_search_volume - season\*2.72\*vax_search_volume - (1-season)\*3.41\*search_volume_vax. The latest raw, unadjusted search volumes are available from [here](https://github.com/ysph-dsde/PopHIVE_DataHub/tree/main/Data/Pulled%20Data/Google%20RSV).

## National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS).

Select laboratories around the United States participate in this system and report the number of positive tests for a virus and the number of tests performed. These data are made available by the CDC.
