This dataset provides the percentage of emergency department patient visits for the specified pathogen of all ED patient visits for the specified geographic part of the country that were observed for the given week from data submitted to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). In addition, the trend over time is characterized as increasing, decreasing or no change, with exceptions for when there are no data available, the data are too sparse, or there are not enough data to compute a trend. These data are to provide awareness of how the weekly trend is changing for the given geographic region.},
