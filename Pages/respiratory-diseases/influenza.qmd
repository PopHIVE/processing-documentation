## National Wastewater Surveillance Program (NWSS)

Testing for viruses in wastewater can provide an efficient way to identify the levels of virus circulation in the community. The CDCâ€™s National Wastewater Surveillance program obtains samples from select communities around the US and presents the data aggregated by state. These data can provide an early indication of viral activity. Limitations include an inability to link detected back to particular groups of individuals and challenges in comparing viral levels across sites that use different methodologies. The sewage is not necessarily representative of the entire population. These data are made available by the CDC.
