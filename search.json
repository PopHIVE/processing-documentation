First, a random-digit-dialing sample of telephone numbers is drawn. When a household with at least one age-eligible child (or adolescent) is contacted, the interviewer collects demographic and access-related information on all children aged 19–35 months or one randomly selected adolescent aged 13–17 years, the mother, and the household, and obtains permission to contact the children’s vaccination providers. Second, identified providers are sent vaccination history questionnaires by mail. Final weighted estimates are adjusted for households without telephones and for nonresponse. All vaccination coverage estimates are based on provider-reported vaccination histories.…. Children’s health insurance status was reported by the parent/guardian. ‘Other insurance’ includes the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), military insurance, coverage via the Indian Health Service, and any other type of health insurance not mentioned elsewhere.”\n\nThe ‘Combined 7 series’ refers to the receipt of seven important vaccines for children: ≥4 doses of DTaP vaccine against diptheria, tetanus, and pertussis; ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine; ≥1 dose of measles vaccine (i.e.., MMR); ≥3 or ≥4 doses of Hib vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae, type B; ≥3 doses of Hepatitis B vaccine; ≥1 dose of varicella; and ≥4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine",

VAERS is co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of adverse events (possible side effects) after a person has received a vaccination. Anyone can report an adverse event to VAERS. Healthcare professionals are required to report certain adverse events and vaccine manufacturers are required to report all adverse events that come to their attention.\nVAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences to CDC and FDA. VAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused a health problem, but is especially useful for detecting unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse event reporting that might indicate a possible safety problem with a vaccine. This way, VAERS can provide CDC and FDA with valuable information that additional work and evaluation is necessary to further assess a possible safety concern.\n\n\nProgram Landing Page:\ndata.gov API Source:\n\n\n\nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System\nVAERS Data Sets",

We obtained Google Search volume by week and state for ‘RSV’ and for the category ‘Respiratory syncytial virus vaccine’ (11j30ybfx6). We are interested in searches related to clinical activity, not due to searching for information on the vaccine. These two time series show distinct patterns. Searches for RSV vaccines surge in early-Fall. Searches for ‘rsv’ in general have a small hump in early fall that corresponds to the searches for vaccine information, and a second peak later in the fall and into the winter that corresponds to the seasonal epidemic.\nTo subtract out the signal of vaccination searches from the general RSV signal, we fit a mixed effects model where the outcome was search volume for RSV by state and week, the covariate was search volume for RSV vaccines by week and state in the summer months, and there was a random intercept for state.

HCUP databases bring together the data collection efforts of State data organizations, hospital associations, private data organizations, and the Federal government to create a national information resource of encounter-level healthcare data (HCUP Partners). HCUP includes the largest collection of longitudinal hospital care data in the United States, with all-payer, encounter-level information beginning in 1988. These databases enable research on a broad range of health policy issues, including cost and quality of health services, medical practice patterns, access to healthcare programs, and outcomes of treatments at the national, State, and local market levels.\n\n\n\nProgram Landing Page:\nhcup-us.ahrq.gov:\n\n\n\nHealthcare Cost & Utilization Project (HCUP)\nQuarterly and Annual Rates for Opioid-Related Hospital Use\n\n\n\n\nState Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS)\nDescription from their page:\n\nCDC’s Overdose Data to Action in States (OD2A-S) program supports 49 states and the District of Columbia to provide comprehensive data to the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS). Each of these 50 funded jurisdictions collects and abstracts data on drug overdose deaths from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, and postmortem toxicology reports for entry into a web-based CDC platform that is shared with the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). States and local jurisdictions are increasingly better informed by systems like SUDORS, which presents comprehensive information on the characteristics and circumstances surrounding drug overdose deaths.\n\n\nThe overall goal of SUDORS is to inform overdose prevention and response efforts by: 1. Providing a better understanding of the circumstances that surround overdose deaths 2. Identifying specific substances causing or contributing to overdose deaths, as well as emerging and polysubstance overdose trends 3. Improving fatal overdose data timeliness and accuracy\n\n\n\nProgram Landing Page:\ncdc.gov:\n\n\n\nAbout the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS)\nSUDORS Dashboard: Fatal Drug Overdose Data\n\n\n\n\nCDC Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER)\nDescription from their page:\n\nThe Multiple Cause of Death data available on WONDER are county-level national mortality and population data spanning the years 1999-2023. Data are based on death certificates for U.S. residents. Each death certificate contains a single underlying cause of death, up to twenty additional multiple causes, and demographic data. The number of deaths, crude death rates, age-adjusted death rates and 95% confidence intervals for death rates can be obtained by cause of death (4 digit ICD-10 codes, 113 selected causes of death, 130 selected causes of infant death, drug and alcohol related causes of death, injury intent and injury mechanism categories), place of residence (national, region, division, state, and county), age (single-year-of age, 5-year age groups, 10-year age groups and infant age groups), race (American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, Black or African American, White), Hispanic ethnicity, sex and year. Data are also available by place of death, month and week day of death, and whether an autopsy was performed.\n\n\n\nProgram Landing Page:\nwonder.cdc.gov:\n\n\n\nCDC WONDER\nMultiple Cause of Death by Single Race 2018-2023\n\n\n\n\nData Dictionary\n\n\n\n\n\nSignal\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\nIndicates the dataset from which the values are derived.\n\n\n\n\n\nState\n\n\nData are aggregated at the state level. Coverage depends on the reach of the respective programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nObservations are accurate to the nearest quarter unless Quarter = NA, in which case the values reflect the annual rate. The time span captured is from 2016 to 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarter\n\n\nEach three-month span starts at the beginning of January, April, July, and October, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nAll places, Medical Facility – Inpatient (IP), or Medical Facility - Outpatient or ER (ED).   CDC WONDER Place of Death Description   HCUP draws inpatient data from the State Inpatient Databases (SID). The SID are limited to patients treated in community hospitals in the State. Community hospitals are defined as short-term, non-Federal, general, and other hospitals, excluding hospital units of other institutions (e.g., prisons). Included among community hospitals are obstetrics and gynecology, otolaryngology, orthopedic, cancer, pediatric, public, and academic medical hospitals. Excluded are community hospitals that are also long-term care facilities such as rehabilitation, psychiatric, and alcoholism and chemical dependency hospitals.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderlying Cause of Death\n\n\nAll Causes of Death and Unintentional (ICD -10 codes X40-X44 and Y10-Y14 together). Selected from subset ICD codes by Drug/Alcohol Induced cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug\n\n\nEach coding listed below is provided separately and grouped: “All opioids (T40.0 - T40.4, T40.6, F11.0)”, “All opioids + Benzodiazepines”, “All opioids + Cocaine”   Opioids: ICD-10 T40.0 (Opium), T40.1 (Heroin), T40.2 (Other opioids), T40.3 (Methadone), T40.4 (Other synthetic narcotics), T40.6 (Other and unspecified narcotics), F11.0 (Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of opioids, acute intoxication).   Stimulants: T40.5 (Cocaine) and general stimulants (as defined by SUDORS).   Depressants: T42 (Benzodiazepines) and general depressants (as defined by SUDORS).   Polysubstance: Combinations of opioids with Cocaine or Benzodiazepines.   For the SUDORS data sets, ICD codes were not required. Data could reflect coronary toxicology results not explicitly categorized the same as ICD.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\n\n\nNot Stratified, Age, Sex, or Race/Ethnicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nCharacteristics are further broken down into the following groupings relevant to their characteristic stratification:  - Age: &lt;24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65+  - Sex: Male, Female  - Race/Ethnicity: AIAN, Asian, Black, Hispanic, NHPI, and White.   For CDC WONDER, the Not Hispanic or Latino with Single Race - 6 Race Categories (“3. Select demographics” and “1. Organize table layout”, respectively) was selected. Single Race description link. Hispanic Origin (“1. Organize table layout” only). Hispanic Origin description link.\n\n\n\n\n\nCount\n\n\nRaw counts of qualifying events. Counts &lt; 20 drug overdose deaths are suppressed for confidentiality or to limit the reporting of unstable rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Adjusted Rate\n\n\nRates are age-adjusted for drug-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific rates using the 2010 U.S. Census population. The numerator represents the occurrent population with the residency population as the denominator. To clarify these rate differences, they will be split between two columns. Rates are multiplied by the constant per 100,000 persons.   Outcomes representing age group levels are not age-adjusted.   Numerical placeholders are adjusted to adhere to the nomeclature used in the CDC WONDER data cleaning steps.  - Not Applicable = NA  - Unreliable = 0.888 or 8888  - Suppressed = 0.999 or 9999  - Incomplete = 0.777 (for generating the quarters) or 7777\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation\n\n\nPopulation values used to generate rates were recalculated directly from the provided rates and counts to improve data continuity by dataset when aggregating characteristic groupings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\nThe following summarizes specific data collection, processing, and reporting characteristics that might impact the interpretation of results. Efforts were made to find opportunities for cross-source comparison, but some data collection processes differ significantly, making direct comparison unwarranted.\nAdditional data processing notes have been recorded in the code: Harmonizing Script_Opioid OD Data.R and Compile CDC Wonder TXT Output.R for notes specific to data export and compilation for CDC WONDER. Notes summarizing the data export process from CDC WONDER can be found here: Opioid Overdose Harmonization_Query Methods, Plots, and Notes.pdf.\n\nAll rates reflect events per 100,000 persons.\nCoded numerical values were introduced to denote suppressed, missing, or unreliable values.\n\nNA: “Not Available” or ”Not Applicable”, depending on the situation (CDC WONDER Documentation). Aggregated NA’s imply all components were NA.\n7777: Incomplete information. This was introduced during aggregation of age-groups or dates and indicates at least component was missing, NA, 8888, or 9999.\n8888: Rates are unreliable as the numerator is 20 or less.\n9999: Suppressed counts to ensure the criteria for confidentiality constraints (CDC WONDER Documentation). Aggregated 9999 imply all components were suppressed.\n\nHCUP’s documentation did not imply that the rates were age-adjusted, justifying all of them being labeled as crude rates, only.\nAge-adjusted rates are available for entries that have not been stratified by age. CDC WONDER used the 2000 Census population for age-adjustments, and SUDORS used the 2010 U.S. Census population.\nUnderlying Cause of Death outcomes are defined by the CDC WONDER definition for that variable, and selections were made based on the UCD - Drug/Alcohol Induced Causes subset of ICD-10 codes (Step 6. Select underlying cause of death). “All” means any available underlying cause of death code, and “Unintentional” selects Drug poisonings (overdose) Unintentional (X40-X44) and only Drug poisonings (overdose) Undetermined (Y10-Y14).\nDrug outcomes indicated as “All” are only present in the SUDORS dataset. These are drug overdose/poisoning events involving opioids, stimulants, depressants, or polysubstances.\n“All Opioids” is defined by the HCUP documentation, including ICD-10 codes T40.0 (Opium), T40.1 (Heroin), T40.2 (Other opioids), T40.3 (Methadone), T40.4 (Other synthetic narcotics), T40.6 (Other and unspecified narcotics), F11.0 (Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of opioids, acute intoxication).\nOverdose events involving multiple drug types (polysubstances) were included for the SUDORS and CDC WONDER datasets. SUDORS batches opioid plus any stimulants (including Cocaine) or depressants (including Benzodiazepines). CDC WONDER only included the ICD-10 codes T42.4 (Benzodiazepines) and T40.5 (Cocaine).",
